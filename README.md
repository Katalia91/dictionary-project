# English Dictionary
English Word Explorer is a single-page application built with React, allowing users to search for English words and get detailed information including definitions, pronunciation, synonyms, and related images. The project is created with Create React App and uses APIs provided by SheCodes. The styling is done with SCSS.

## Features

- **Search Engine**: Users can search for any English word. The results will include detailed definitions, pronunciation, and synonyms.

- **Image Results (Planned)**: The application connects to a separate API to fetch images related to the searched word.

- **Note Functionality (Planned - nice to have)**: A future update will include a note-taking feature where users can copy definitions to a note and save it for later reference. The notes will be editable and will be displayed in a sidebar.
